# Indvidual Project

This ToDo List project is an individual project conducted within the scope of training conducted by SDA, KTU and Novare Potential.

# Project Title: 
ToDo List

# Problem Statement: 
The problem statement of this project is “to build a “ToDo List application”.

# Project Objectives: 
The project is a “ToDo List” project. In this project, a “ToDo List” application will be developed. This program will be coded in Java programming language. With this application, the following objects are determined:

•	to create new tasks, 
•	assign them a title and due date, 
•	and choose a project for that task to belong to. 
•	They will need to use a text based user interface via the command-line. 
•	the user should be able to also edit, 
•	mark as done or remove tasks. 
•	They can also quit and save the current task list to file, 
•	restart the application with the former state restored. 

# Project Scope:

The application will be displayed on the screen by adding the project name, date, task and status specified for the “ToDo List” and can be saved to the file if desired. Save lists can be viewed, sorted, modified or deleted.

# Goals

The goals of the project are follows: 
•	Model a task with a task title, due date, status and project 
•	Display a collection of tasks that can be sorted both by date and project 
•	Support the ability to add, edit, mark as done, and remove tasks 
•	Support a text-based user interface 
•	Load and save task list to file 
•	other creative features 

# Methods
•	Research
•	Analyze
•	Design

# Common Impact/Added Value

The application is important for learning programming. With this application, the most basic elements of object oriented programming will be reinforced. In addition, it can be developed later and different people can use this application. More importantly, it will provide insight and inspiration in research and learning in different people.
